# Captcha-Using-Clustering-and-NN

An intelligent CAPTCHA breaking system that combines clustering techniques with neural networks to automatically recognize and solve text-based CAPTCHAs. This project demonstrates the intersection of unsupervised learning, computer vision, and deep learning for automated pattern recognition. This project is limited to 5 characters with various combinations. The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fournierp/captcha-version-2-images/data
